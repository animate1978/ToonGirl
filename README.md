# ToonGirl
An example model for MB-Lab built between 2019 and 2021

This is an incomplete "new" character model for MB-Lab that started development in 2019, and ended in 2021. This was not a "production" model as more of a prototype that proved the possiblity of actually adding in new character models.

There is a lot wrong with this model and the current MB-Lab version. It does load at a basic level.

## Known Issues

- There is only 1 morph to change the appearance of the model
- There is no character library
- Random Generator only has 4 parameters to choose from
- BVH animations produce odd results

## Installation

To install is very easy, just download the ZIP and extract to the MB-Lab folder.

## Use

To use this model in MB-Lab switch the Project to Toon and then Select ToonGirl (F_TN01)(CC0)
